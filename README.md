# React Router Example Project

This is a simple example project demonstrating how to use React Router for navigation in a React application. The project includes a basic navigation bar and three different pages: Home, About Us, and Contact Us. You can use this project as a starting point for your own React applications that require routing.


## Technology Stack
- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

- React Router: A library that allows you to add routing and navigation to your React applications. 


## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- src/components/header.js: This file contains the navigation bar component, Headers, which is displayed at the top of the application. It uses the Link component from react-router-dom for navigation links.

- src/pages/Home.js: This file contains the Home page component. It displays a simple "Home Page" message.

- src/pages/About.js: This file contains the About page component. It displays an "About" message.

- src/pages/Contact.js: This file contains the Contact page component. It displays a "Contact" message.

- src/App.js: This is the main application component that defines the routing using the BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components.

- src/index.js: This file initializes the React application and renders the App component wrapped in a BrowserRouter.

- public/index.html: The HTML template for the application.

- public/index.css: The project's CSS styles.


## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the project from the repository.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Install the project dependencies by running:
   [npm install]
5. Start the development server by running:
   [npm start]
6. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000. You can open this URL in your web browser to see the React Router in action.



## Usage
This project serves as a basic template for building React applications with routing. You can extend it by adding more components and routes as needed for your application. Feel free to customize the styles, content, and functionality to fit your specific requirements.
